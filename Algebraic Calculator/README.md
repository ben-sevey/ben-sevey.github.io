# Algebraic-Calculator

A simple web app for simplifying and solving linear equations. The calculator handles
first-order linear equations with up to 26 (one for each lowercase letter) variables.
Project was built with simple javascript, and utilizes the fraction.js library.

Input an expression with any alphabetic characters (lowercase for now) to simplify.<br/>
Ex. 8x * 2 + 9 * (y + y)  => 16x + 2y + 9<br/>
Input two expressions separated by an equal sign to solve for the value of a single variable<br/>
Ex. 5u - 7 = 2u + 11 => u = 6<br/>
Input multiple linear equations, each separated by a comma to solve for the value of each variable<br/>
Ex. x + y + z = 6, 3x - y - 2z = -3, -2x - 5y + 2z = 11 => x=2, y=-1, z=5
